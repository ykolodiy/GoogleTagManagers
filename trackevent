If I were implementing this I would create a custom HTML tag containing a function that binds to the onchange event fo your select element. The function would fire a custom event into the dataLayer which also contains pertinent information. You would then create a UA event tracking tag that uses the correct information and is fired by a custom trigger that is fired by the custom event name.

So, as follows:

Create Custom HTML tag with some similar functionality to this, fire it on DOM ready of all pages you want to bind to a select element:

<script>
  $('#myselect').on('change', function(){
    dataLayer.push({
      'event':'select_change',
      'select_val':this.value
    });
  });
</script>
Create a trigger of type custom event where event value = select_change

Create a Universal Analytics tag which is an event tag and fill in the the required details (category, action, label, value). If this was me I'd use something like
category = user interaction
action = select change
label = {{select_val}}
This tag shoudl be fired by the trigger you created in 2.
